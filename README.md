### Grocery List Project

This is a simple grocery list project built in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. It was built as part of [Launch School's](https://launchschool.com/) JS230 course.

The goal of this project is to practice working with the DOM and event listeners. The primary focus was on the Javascript and jQuery portion of the code and less on the HTML and CSS.
